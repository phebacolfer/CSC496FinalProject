desc: "This outing idea is a little more expensive than a few of the others on this site, but it's worth every penny! A fun day in a museum allows you to spend time together in a calm and interesting environment. The museum can be chosen to accomodate your needs and preferences, and it's a great opprtunity to share in a fun experience without needing to get creative or buy a lot of supplies. Also, it's up to you all how long you want to stay there, so it's great or a relaxed weekend or a busy day!"
