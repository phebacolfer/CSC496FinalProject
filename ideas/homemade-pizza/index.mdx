desc: "This one is a low-stakes, fun addition to a night at home! First, purchase the supplies needed to create a personal pizza for each partcipant from your favorite online recipe! As tempting as it may be to simply purchase a pizza, part of the fun here is getting to customize and create your food together. Then, use a random number generator, coin toss, dice roll, or other fair and random way of selecting the secondary activity selector for the night. The winner can choose the movie, video game, board game, show, or other laid back activity to enjoy while baking and eating your pizza. If another activity together is desired after the pizza is eaten and the initial choice has been finished, feel free to switch to a new chooser and let them pick what you do next!"
