desc: "This idea can be as expensive or cheap as you choose to make it, and the effort levels can also vary depending on your needs and preferences! Whether you want to take sandwiches and soda to the beach, cheese and bread and juice to the park, trailmix and water to the woods, champagne and caviar to an island, or any other combination of location and food is completely up to you! First, find a location that the participants agree would be fun or romantic. Then, plan a menu around what is desired, safe, and feasible for the participants. Before going, ensure that the weather is still favorable and the location is still open. In the case of an unexpected picnic obstacle, get creative! Maybe you all could build a fort in the living room and have your picnic there, or put up a tent in the backyard? The possiblities are only as limited as your imagination!"
