cost: "Low"
num: "1"
supplies: "A screen for watching, snacks (optional), a comfortable place to watch a movie"
desc: "This one is another affordable and easy outing activity! All you need is one or more people to watch a movie with and a way to watch the movie! Whether that's a projector on the ceiling while you sit in beanbags, a drive-in theater, a regular movie theater, or a night on the couch watching a movie on the TV, this idea is a simple easy classic for a reason. This idea pairs well with other ideas that take less time and focus or have a lot of downtime, such as the Homemade Pizza idea! Use a random number generator, set of dice, coin flip, or regular old verbal agreement to decide who picks the movie!"
