First, purchase the supplies needed to create a personal pizza for each partcipant from your favorite online recipe! As tempting as it may be to simply purchase a pizza, part of the fun here is getting to customize and create your food together. Then, use a random number generator, coin toss, dice roll, or other fair and random way of selecting the secondary activity selector for the night. The winner can choose the movie, video game, board game, show, or other laid back activity to enjoy while baking and eating your pizza.

First, find a location that the participants agree would be fun or romantic. Then, plan a menu around what is desired, safe, and feasible for the participants. Before going, ensure that the weather is still favorable and the location is still open. In the case of an unexpected picnic obstacle, get creative!
